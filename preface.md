This is a book about reinventing the wheel. It is an experiment, that you might want to be involved or just read and enjoy.

First of all, this is going to be a book from two parts. This is part I, which is for the past and part II will be for the present. I am going to write both parts in parallel but you will be able to read just the first part. This preface is necessarily to be written in the present, even that this is the field for part II.

In this book, we have some rules for you, as a reader or participant, before you to read ahead. If you agree with all of them, then you are welcome.

  1. You should try really hard to keep me blind and uninformed for everything related to this book or its subject. Than means then when all this becomes more famous I should not know about it. Should not be thanked, encouraged, criticized, contacted or whatever.

  2. Since this is an experiment, it could never end or be finished in any reasonable way. So that I could write 40 pages of this book and die in a crash or I could just lose interest. This is more a warning than a rule.

  3. You can clone this book (repository), edit, translate, criticize on your blog, book, newspaper, tv etc. only if you include this keyword in the text "reinventingdwheel" or play the following sound "reinventingdwheel" (TODO: create a simple sound file) or show constantly the following sign/letter "D" with yellow color on gray background.
  This rule is specifically for me, because I am a software developer and will create some tools to help me stay blind for these news. Using the above signs I will help you better keep this a secret from me and keep rule number 1.

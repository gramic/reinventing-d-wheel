This is a book about reinventing the wheel. It is an experiment, that you might want to be involved or just read and enjoy.

First of all, this is going to be a book from two parts. This is part I, which is for the past and part II will be for the present. I am going to write both parts in parallel but you will be able to read just the first part. This preface is necessarily to be written in the present, even that this is the field for part II.

In this book, we have some rules for you, as a reader or participant, before you to read ahead. If you agree with all of them, then you are welcome.

  1. You should try (especially really hard if you know me in person) to keep me blind and uninformed for everything related to this book or its subject. Than means then when all this becomes more famous I should not know about it. Should not be thanked, encouraged, criticized, contacted or whatever. The consequence is that you might get mentioned in the second part of this book, how you screwed this exeprement. :)

  2. Since this is an experiment, it could never end or be finished in any reasonable way. So that I could write 40 pages of this book and die in a crash or I could just lose interest. This is more a warning than a rule.

  3. You can clone this book (repository), edit, translate, criticize on your blog, book, newspaper, tv, radio show (I think the license allows all this), etc. Only if you include this keyword in the text "reinventingdwheel", or play the following sound "reinventingdwheel" (TODO: create a simple sound file) or show constantly the following sign/letter "D" with yellow color on gray circle background at the bottom right corner.
  This rule is specifically for me, because I am a software developer and will create some tools to help me stay blind for that information (TODO: create the tools so other can use them too). Using the above signs I will help you better keep the secret from me and keep the promised rule number 1.

If you are close to me and maybe know me personally, please consider to not read this book and try to act like I do. Stay uninformed and blind. You can use the tools that I will publish as soon as I create them.

I am not a book writer and do not know English so good, but I chose to write in English because it is better suited for this experiment. Considering this, you are mostly encouraged to clone this repository as in rule number 3 suggests. My native language is Bulgarian, so a translation in Bulgarian is especially needed. As a whole, this book/repository should not be read directly from here, but from a clone.

My goal is to write every day, at least a page, in both parts. So I think you will be able to read this book every day. You will have answers to you questions probably at part II of the book. The first part will stop (be finished) when I get to today and will continue in the second part. My expectation is that the two parts will not be quite in sync to finish both of them at the same time. However I will try to do just that. So you will be able to read the second part as a whole book at once.

The second part of the book will be for the present and will continue from the first part. However, the second will contain my thoughts and actions in much different way then the first. Since this book is one thing and the first part is in the past, while the second is for the present.

One last thing. Do not click on the following link until you read this paragraph. If you are famous (like 100 000 people know you), you should search your name in this spoiler (TODO: make it a link) list of names. These people are part of this book story and if you do not want to get spoiled (definition: like knowing something before you read the whole story) do Not read/click it. If you are part of this spoiler list, please, be extra careful and probably follow the advice like you are a person who knows me in person even that you actually do not know me at all :)
